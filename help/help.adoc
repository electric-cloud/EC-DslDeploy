== Procedures

IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required parameters are shown in [.required]#bold italics#.



=== InstallDsl

Deploy a DSL file structure from an Artifact Version on your {PRODUCT} server.

[cols="1a,1a",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Artifact Name |The name of your artifact.
|Artifact Version |The version of the artifact you want to deploy. If empty, the latest version is deployed.
NOTE: Use an empty version only in your `Dev` environment. In higher environments, it's recommended that you use a specific version that has been tested in lower environments.

|Pool or Resource |The name of the pool or resource where the artifact will be retrieved. The DSL is evaluated on the server so all system actions, such as file reads, will be evaluated on a server node.

Default value is `local`.
|Retrieve on All server nodes |Use this option when running in a cluster with a local workspace, as the artifact version needs to be retrieved on all nodes (as the system pick a random server node for each action). Use alongside a resource pool covering all server node agents for the parameter above.

Default is `false`
|Overwrite mode |Select to enable overwrite mode. If the object exists, all attributes and child objects are overwritten by the values in the DSL files.
|===

=== InstallDslFromDirectory

Deploy a DSL file structure from a directory on your {PRODUCT} server.

This procedure's main usage is to set up a CI process. It extracts your code from your SCM in a local directory on your `Dev` {PRODUCT} server, and deploys it.

[cols="1a,1a",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Directory Path |The location of the DSL code on your `Dev` {PRODUCT} server.
|Server Pool or Resource |The name of the pool or resource where the artifact will be retrieved. Use `.` if you have retrieved in your workspace.
|Overwrite mode |Select to enable overwrite mode. If the object exists, all attributes and child objects are overwritten by the values in the DSL files.
|Additional argument(s)| For evalDsl calls, additional arguments such as  `--timeout` or `--debug`. Values used in `--timeout` are used as timeouts for ectool, evalDsl, and the job step time out used to import the DSL.
|Ignore failures |Ignore failures during import of DSL files.
|Local mode |Do not send files to the server with help of clientFiles argument of the evalDsl operation in local mode.
|===

[cols="1a,1a",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Project Name |Name of the project to install.
|Project directory |The location of the project DSL code on your `Dev` {PRODUCT} server.
|Overwrite mode |Select to enable overwrite mode. If the object exists, all attributes and child objects are overwritten by the values in the DSL files.
|Additional argument(s)| For evalDsl calls, additional arguments such as  `--timeout` or `--debug`. Values used in `--timeout` are used as timeouts for ectool, evalDsl, and the job step time out used to import the DSL.
|===

image:cloudbees-common-sda::cd-plugins/ec-dsldeploy/help/installproject.png[installProject parameters]

=== GenerateDslToDirectory

Export DSL for a top level {PRODUCT} object, with options for which child objects and values to include. Export the DSL in separate files in a directory tree representing the object hierarchy, for ease of editing and management.

[cols="1a,1a",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Directory path |Folder where the code is generated.
|Server Pool or Resource |Server pool to use for a cluster setup.

|Suppress Defaults |Exclude from the generated DSL properties with default value.
|Suppress Parent |Exclude from the generated DSL properties referred to object parent.
|Include ACLs |Include in ACLs for objects.
|Include All Children |Include in the generated DSL all object children. If `True`, the value of the `Include Children` parameter is ignored.
|Include children |A comma-separated list of object children the DSL should be generated for.
|Include Children in Same File |Include in the generated DSL all object children. If `True`, the value of the `Include Children` parameter is ignored.

=== ImportDslFromGit

IMPORTANT: This procedure is deprecated and relies on the ECSCM-Git plugin, which is no longer supported. Unless you have legacy installations of {PRODUCT}, you should not use it and use <<ImportDslFromGitNew>> instead.
====

====

Import DSL file structure from a Git repository.

This procedure main usage is to set up a CI process.

[cols="1a,1a",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|Destination Directory |The directory on the resource where the source tree is created and from where the DSL files are read to be imported in {PRODUCT} server.
|Cleanup? |This option will delete the destination directory with the source tree after the job execution.
|Overwrite mode |Select to enable overwrite mode. If the object exists, all attributes and child objects are overwritten by the values in the DSL files.
|Configuration |The name of a saved SCM configuration.
|Git repository |The URL to the repository to pull from, for example `git://server/repo.git`.
|Commit Hash |The Commit Hash to update the index.

NOTE: This moves the HEAD.
|Remote Branch |The name of the Git branch to use, for example `my_feature`.
|Clone? |This option will clone a repository into a newly created directory.
|Overwrite? |This option will overwrite a repository if it already exists.
|Depth |Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of revisions.
|Tag |Provide the name of a specific tag to check out after the clone command.
|Ignore failures |Ignore failures during import of DSL files.
|Local mode |Do not send files to the server with help of clientFiles argument of the evalDsl operation in local mode.

=== ImportDslFromGitNew

Import DSL file structure from a Git repository.

This procedure main usage is to set up a CI process.

NOTE: This procedure uses the cd-plugin:ec-git[] plugin.

[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Server Pool or Resource |The resource or one of the pool resources where the DSL files are checked out from Git and imported to the {PRODUCT} server.
|Destination Directory |The directory on the resource where the source tree is created and the DSL files are stored.
|Relative path to DSL files |If the DSL files are not located at the top level in the repository, then specify the relative path to the directory containing the DSL files within the repository. For example, `scripts/dsls` where the DSL files are located in the following sub-directories in the repository `scripts/dsls/projects` and `scripts/dsls/resources`.
|Cleanup? |This option deletes the destination directory with the source tree after the job execution.
|Overwrite mode |Select to enable overwrite mode. If the object exists, all attributes and child objects are overwritten by the values in the DSL files.
|Configuration |`EC-Git` configuration name.
|Git repository |URL to the repository to pull from. For example, `git://server/repo.git`.
|Remote Branch |The name of the Git branch to use. For example, `experimental`.
|Ignore failures |Ignore failures during import of DSL files.
|Local mode |Do not send files to the server with help of `clientFiles`
argument of the `evalDsl` operation in local mode. Available only if the
destination directory is accessible from the {CD} server. In a clustered
deployment, all {PRODUCT} server nodes must have access to this directory.
|Additional DSL arguments |Additional argument(s) for the `evalDsl` call. For example, `--timeout` or `--debug`. Values used in `--timeout` are used as timeouts for `ectool`, `evalDsl`, and the job step timeout used to import the DSL.
|Include objects |New line separated list of paths to objects to synchronize.

If set, only these objects are synchronized. If empty, all available objects are synchronized.

Examples:

* “/projects“ - all projects
* “/projects/Default/applications“ - all applications in project 'Default'
* “/users“ - all users
* “/projects/Commander/procedures/Master“ - ‘Master' procedure in 'Commander’ project
* “/projects/*/releases“ - all releases in all projects

[NOTE]
====
Objects with depth > 2 are not supported. Examples:

* “/projects/*/releases/release1“
* “/projects/Default/application/application1/applicationTiers”
====

If set - synchronize only these objects. If empty - synchronize all available objects.
|Exclude objects |List of paths to objects to exclude. Exclude nothing by default.
|Incremental import |Select to only import the incremental changes that have occurred since the previous run of the procedure. When selected, the previous run's commit ID is compared to the current commit ID in the Git repository and a change list is created. This can potentially reduce the import time because the entire DSL file structure is not re-imported from the Git repository each time the procedure runs.

NOTE: If the commit ID cannot be found or if the procedure or steps cannot find, read, or correctly parse the change list, the entire DSL file structure is re-imported.
